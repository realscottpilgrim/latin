<a name="256"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 13</b>
<a name="257"></a><br><br>Throughout all Gaul there are two orders of those men who are of 
<a name="258"></a>any rank and dignity: for the commonality is held almost in the condition 
<a name="259"></a>of slaves, and dares to undertake nothing of itself, and is admitted to 
<a name="260"></a>no deliberation. The greater part, when they are pressed either by debt, 
<a name="261"></a>or the large amount of their tributes, or the oppression of the more powerful, 
<a name="262"></a>give themselves up in vassalage to the nobles, who possess over them the 
<a name="263"></a>same rights without exception as masters over their slaves. But of these 
<a name="264"></a>two orders, one is that of the Druids, the other that of the knights. The 
<a name="265"></a>former are engaged in things sacred, conduct the public and the private 
<a name="266"></a>sacrifices, and interpret all matters of religion. To these a large number 
<a name="267"></a>of the young men resort for the purpose of instruction, and they [the Druids] 
<a name="268"></a>are in great honor among them. For they determine respecting almost all 
<a name="269"></a>controversies, public and private; and if any crime has been perpetrated, 
<a name="270"></a>if murder has been committed, if there be any dispute about an inheritance, 
<a name="271"></a>if any about boundaries, these same persons decide it; they decree rewards 
<a name="272"></a>and punishments; if any one, either in a private or public capacity, has 
<a name="273"></a>not submitted to their decision, they interdict him from the sacrifices. 
<a name="274"></a>This among them is the most heavy punishment. Those who have been thus 
<a name="275"></a>interdicted are esteemed in the number of the impious and the criminal: 
<a name="276"></a>all shun them, and avoid their society and conversation, lest they receive 
<a name="277"></a>some evil from their contact; nor is justice administered to them when 
<a name="278"></a>seeking it, nor is any dignity bestowed on them. Over all these Druids 
<a name="279"></a>one presides, who possesses supreme authority among them. Upon his death, 
<a name="280"></a>if any individual among the rest is pre-eminent in dignity, he succeeds; 
<a name="281"></a>but, if there are many equal, the election is made by the suffrages of 
<a name="282"></a>the Druids; sometimes they even contend for the presidency with arms. These 
<a name="283"></a>assemble at a fixed period of the year in a consecrated place in the territories 
<a name="284"></a>of the Carnutes, which is reckoned the central region of the whole of Gaul. 
<a name="285"></a>Hither all, who have disputes, assemble from every part, and submit to 
<a name="286"></a>their decrees and determinations. This institution is supposed to have 
<a name="287"></a>been devised in Britain, and to have been brought over from it into Gaul; 
<a name="288"></a>and now those who desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that system 
<a name="289"></a>generally proceed thither for the purpose of studying 
<a name="290"></a>it.
<a name="291"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 14</b>
<a name="292"></a><br><br>The Druids do not go to war, nor pay tribute together with the 
<a name="293"></a>rest; they have an exemption from military service and a dispensation in 
<a name="294"></a>all matters. Induced by such great advantages, many embrace this profession 
<a name="295"></a>of their own accord, and [many] are sent to it by their parents and relations. 
<a name="296"></a>They are said there to learn by heart a great number of verses; accordingly 
<a name="297"></a>some remain in the course of training twenty years. Nor do they regard 
<a name="298"></a>it lawful to commit these to writing, though in almost all other matters, 
<a name="299"></a>in their public and private transactions, they use Greek characters. That 
<a name="300"></a>practice they seem to me to have adopted for two reasons; because they 
<a name="301"></a>neither desire their doctrines to be divulged among the mass of the people, 
<a name="302"></a>nor those who learn, to devote themselves the less to the efforts of memory, 
<a name="303"></a>relying on writing; since it generally occurs to most men, that, in their 
<a name="304"></a>dependence on writing, they relax their diligence in learning thoroughly, 
<a name="305"></a>and their employment of the memory. They wish to inculcate this as one 
<a name="306"></a>of their leading tenets, that souls do not become extinct, but pass after 
<a name="307"></a>death from one body to another, and they think that men by this tenet are 
<a name="308"></a>in a great degree excited to valor, the fear of death being disregarded. 
<a name="309"></a>They likewise discuss and impart to the youth many things respecting the 
<a name="310"></a>stars and their motion, respecting the extent of the world and of our earth, 
<a name="311"></a>respecting the nature of things, respecting the power and the majesty of 
<a name="312"></a>the immortal gods.
<a name="313"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 15</b>
<a name="314"></a><br><br>The other order is that of the knights. These, when there is occasion 
<a name="315"></a>and any war occurs (which before Caesar's arrival was for the most part 
<a name="316"></a>wont to happen every year, as either they on their part were inflecting 
<a name="317"></a>injuries or repelling those which others inflected on them), are all engaged 
<a name="318"></a>in war. And those of them most distinguished by birth and resources, have 
<a name="319"></a>the greatest number of vassals and dependents about them. They acknowledge 
<a name="320"></a>this sort of influence and power only.
<a name="321"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 16</b>
<a name="322"></a><br><br>The nation of all the Gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious 
<a name="323"></a>rites; and on that account they who are troubled with unusually severe 
<a name="324"></a>diseases, and they who are engaged in battles and dangers, either sacrifice 
<a name="325"></a>men as victims, or vow that they will sacrifice them, and employ the Druids 
<a name="326"></a>as the performers of those sacrifices; because they think that unless the 
<a name="327"></a>life of a man be offered for the life of a man, the mind of the immortal 
<a name="328"></a>gods can not be rendered propitious, and they have sacrifices of that kind 
<a name="329"></a>ordained for national purposes. Others have figures of vast size, the limbs 
<a name="330"></a>of which formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on 
<a name="331"></a>fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the oblation 
<a name="332"></a>of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offense, 
<a name="333"></a>is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class 
<a name="334"></a>is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the 
<a name="335"></a>innocent.
<a name="336"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 17</b>
<a name="337"></a><br><br>They worship as their divinity, Mercury in particular, and have 
<a name="338"></a>many images of him, and regard him as the inventor of all arts, they consider 
<a name="339"></a>him the guide of their journeys and marches, and believe him to have great 
<a name="340"></a>influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile transactions. Next 
<a name="341"></a>to him they worship Apollo, and Mars, and Jupiter, and Minerva; respecting 
<a name="342"></a>these deities they have for the most part the same belief as other nations: 
<a name="343"></a>that Apollo averts diseases, that Minerva imparts the invention of manufactures, 
<a name="344"></a>that Jupiter possesses the sovereignty of the heavenly powers; that Mars 
<a name="345"></a>presides over wars. To him, when they have determined to engage in battle, 
<a name="346"></a>they commonly vow those things which they shall take in war. When they 
<a name="347"></a>have conquered, they sacrifice whatever captured animals may have survived 
<a name="348"></a>the conflict, and collect the other things into one place. In many states 
<a name="349"></a>you may see piles of these things heaped up in their consecrated spots; 
<a name="350"></a>nor does it often happen that any one, disregarding the sanctity of the 
<a name="351"></a>case, dares either to secrete in his house things captured, or take away 
<a name="352"></a>those deposited; and the most severe punishment, with torture, has been 
<a name="353"></a>established for such a deed.
<a name="354"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 18</b>
<a name="355"></a><br><br>All the Gauls assert that they are descended from the god Dis, 
<a name="356"></a>and say that this tradition has been handed down by the Druids. For that 
<a name="357"></a>reason they compute the divisions of every season, not by the number of 
<a name="358"></a>days, but of nights; they keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and 
<a name="359"></a>years in such an order that the day follows the night. Among the other 
<a name="360"></a>usages of their life, they differ in this from almost all other nations, 
<a name="361"></a>that they do not permit their children to approach them openly until they 
<a name="362"></a>are grown up so as to be able to bear the service of war; and they regard 
<a name="363"></a>it as indecorous for a son of boyish age to stand in public in the presence 
<a name="364"></a>of his father.
<a name="365"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 19</b>
<a name="366"></a><br><br>Whatever sums of money the husbands have received in the name of 
<a name="367"></a>dowry from their wives, making an estimate of it, they add the same amount 
<a name="368"></a>out of their own estates. An account is kept of all this money conjointly, 
<a name="369"></a>and the profits are laid by: whichever of them shall have survived [the 
<a name="370"></a>other], to that one the portion of both reverts together with the profits 
<a name="371"></a>of the previous time. Husbands have power of life and death over their 
<a name="372"></a>wives as well as over their children: and when the father of a family, 
<a name="373"></a>born in a more than commonly distinguished rank, has died, his relations 
<a name="374"></a>assemble, and, if the circumstances of his death are suspicious, hold an 
<a name="375"></a>investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted toward slaves; and, 
<a name="376"></a>if proof be obtained, put them to severe torture, and kill them. Their 
<a name="377"></a>funerals, considering the state of civilization among the Gauls, are magnificent 
<a name="378"></a>and costly; and they cast into the fire all things, including living creatures, 
<a name="379"></a>which they suppose to have been dear to them when alive; and, a little 
<a name="380"></a>before this period, slaves and dependents, who were ascertained to have 
<a name="381"></a>been beloved by them, were, after the regular funeral rites were completed, 
<a name="382"></a>burnt together with them.
<a name="383"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 20</b>
<a name="384"></a><br><br>Those states which are considered to conduct their commonwealth 
<a name="385"></a>more judiciously, have it ordained by their laws, that, if any person shall 
<a name="386"></a>have heard by rumor and report from his neighbors any thing concerning 
<a name="387"></a>the commonwealth, he shall convey it to the magistrate, and not impart 
<a name="388"></a>it to any other; because it has been discovered that inconsiderate and 
<a name="389"></a>inexperienced men were often alarmed by false reports, and driven to some 
<a name="390"></a>rash act, or else took hasty measures in affairs of the highest importance. 
<a name="391"></a>The magistrates conceal those things which require to be kept unknown; 
<a name="392"></a>and they disclose to the people whatever they determine to be expedient. 
<a name="393"></a>It is not lawful to speak of the commonwealth, except in 
<a name="394"></a>council.
<a name="395"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 21</b>
<a name="396"></a><br><br>The Germans differ much from these usages, for they have neither 
<a name="397"></a>Druids to preside over sacred offices, nor do they pay great regard to 
<a name="398"></a>sacrifices. They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold, 
<a name="399"></a>and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited, namely, the 
<a name="400"></a>sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even 
<a name="401"></a>by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits 
<a name="402"></a>of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and 
<a name="403"></a>hardships. Those who have remained chaste for the longest time, receive 
<a name="404"></a>the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this the 
<a name="405"></a>growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews 
<a name="406"></a>are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth 
<a name="407"></a>year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of which matter there 
<a name="408"></a>is no concealment, because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and [only] 
<a name="409"></a>use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides, a large portion of the body 
<a name="410"></a>being in consequence naked.
<a name="411"></a><br><br><b>Chapter 22</b>
<a name="412"></a><br><br>They do not pay much attention to agriculture, and a large portion 
<a name="413"></a>of their food consists in milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has any one a fixed 
<a name="414"></a>quantity of land or his own individual limits; but the magistrates and 
<a name="415"></a>the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families, who have 
<a name="416"></a>united together, as much land as, and in the place in which, they think 
<a name="417"></a>proper, and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere. For this enactment 
<a name="418"></a>they advance many reasons - lest seduced by long-continued custom, they 
<a name="419"></a>may exchange their ardor in the waging of war for agriculture; lest they 
<a name="420"></a>may be anxious to acquire extensive estates, and the more powerful drive 
<a name="421"></a>the weaker from their possessions; lest they construct their houses with 
<a name="422"></a>too great a desire to avoid cold and heat; lest the desire of wealth spring 
<a name="423"></a>up, from which cause divisions and discords arise; and that they may keep 
<a name="424"></a>the common people in a contented state of mind, when each sees his own 
<a name="425"></a>means placed on an equality with [those of] the most 
<a name="426"></a>powerful.
